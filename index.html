			<h2 class= "sub-headings">Baby Otto</h2>
			<p> Otto was born on April 1 (makes sense because he is an actual <b>fool</b>), 2015. He was born in Granite City, Illinois, along with 7 other equally ridiculous looking siblings. My boyfriend (now <i>fiance</i>!) and I brought him home on my 25th birthday. For the first 3 weeks of his life, I couldn't decide on a name, so he answered only to "Little Wayne". I eventually decided to name him "Otto" after Otto Rocket from Nickelodeon's show Rocket Power<sup>&reg;</sup>. At 8 weeks old, he was smaller than his head is now. We traveled back to our home in Tower Grove Heights, and our house and our lives were <b>NEVER</b> the same or quiet again.

			<p> Otto is an English Bull Terrier. I have been obsessed since I was little and first saw Bud Light's advertisements featuring Spuds Mackenzie. Before deciding that I just HAD to have one of my own, I did my research. I read articles upon articles stating the same things "bull terriers are historically stubborn", "bull terriers are obstinate", "bull terriers are not suitable for inexperienced dog owners". I read all of this and thought "Ha, not <b>ALL</b> bull terriers" and "whatever, I can do it". Let this be a cautionary tale. After 5 years with Otto, I can say, YES, ALL bull terriers are stubborn. Bull terriers were bred to be bull-baiting dogs in Britain. Once this was illegal, they became fashionable companions and were bred to look like the "egg heads" we know now.  </p>

			<p> Otto has a lot of...quirks. He's very specific. The first, that is very Otto-specific, is that he will not walk around things that are in his path. If there is a toy, a shoe, or even a cord, in his path from point A to point B, he will not simply walk around or over said item. Instead, he will look around for the nearest human and bark until human removes the offender and then and only then, will he continue walking. The second, which is more bull terrier-specific, is that he sits like a human. He sits up straight, with his arm resting on the nearest thing that can be considered an arm rest. </p>

			<p>While he may act it, Otto is not an only child. He has an older sister named Oakley. Oakley is an 8 year old rescue that came to us by way of the Humane Society of Missouri when she was 1 year old. Oakley is the opposite of Otto in every way. She is 100% our more trustworthy dog. She can be left unattended and I know will full confidence that our house will still be standing. She is calm, cool, and collected while her brother is...not. When first introduced to her new brother, Oakley avoided Otto at all costs. If Otto was in a room, Oakley would leave the room. If Otto was blocking a hallway, Oakley would stare from afar until he moved. Luckily, they have moved past this stage and Otto has become Oakley's shadow, and Oakley tolerates him.   </p>
